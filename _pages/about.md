<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a PhD student at [Keio University](http://www.hvrl.ics.keio.ac.jp/) under the guidance of [Prof. Hideo Saito](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=JU9x-bcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Starting from this May, I will be visiting the [University of Bristol](https://uob-mavi.github.io/people/) as a visiting PhD student and working with [Prof. Dima Damen](https://dimadamen.github.io/).

My research interests span the broad area of machine learning, computer vision, egocentric vision, multimodal learning, future forecasting, and action recognition.

In 2023, I obtained a Master's degree in computer science from [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/), Japan, and an engineering degree from [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), France, in 2023 as part of a double degree program.
